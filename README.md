I've decided to open source the most minimalistic approach to sniping Raydium pools that is currently possible.

Disclaimer: This is not the the ideal sniper as it still uses RPC calls.

If you're interested in sniping pools with 0 RPC calls and land txs in the block after pool creation feel free to add me on Discord: shadowystupidcoder
